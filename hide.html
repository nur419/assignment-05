            <p class="text-gray-500"> The DOM makes a website dynamic. it has some propertise ,such as .getElementById Selects the element with a specified id attribute.
                getElementsByClassName Selects all elements with a specified class name.
                getElementsByTagName Selects all elements with a specified tag name.
                querySelector Selects the first element that matches a specified CSS selector.
                querySelectorAllSelects all elements that match a specified CSS selector.

            <hr class="border-1 border-dashed border-indigo-600 m-3">
            <p class="text-gray-500"> innerHTML, innerText, and textContent are all used to access or modify the text
                     content of an HTML element, but they do so in different ways.
                     innerHTML interprets the content as HTML, allowing you to retrieve or set 
                     HTML elements within the element. innerText returns the rendered text content,
                     respecting CSS styling and omitting hidden text. textContent retrieves the
                     full text content as it exists in the source code, including hidden text and 
                     without interpreting HTML. When setting content, both innerText and textContent replace
                     the existing content with plain text, while innerHTML interprets the new content
                     as HTML.

            <hr class="border-1 border-dashed border-indigo-600 m-3">
            <p class="text-gray-500"> Event bubbling in the DOM is a process where an event originating from 
                  a specific element propagates up the DOM tree to its parent elements. When an event occurs on  
                  that element's event handlers are executed. Then, the event "bubbles" up to the element's
                  an element,immediate parent, triggering the same event on that parent. This continues up the tree, 
                  triggering the event on each ancestor element until it reaches the root of the document.
                  Event bubbling allows for event delegation, where a single handler on a parent element can
                  manage events for multiple child elements.
